# Magic actions belt hider

## Why?
Magic actions for youtube is an awesome chrome extension, but sometimes it's belt hides some youtube data, like "youtube" button, after some changes in yt's html.

In that case I wrote an extension which will hide magic actions' belt on demand.

## How to run
Download extension from chrome web store or clone from that repository and upload it to chrome. 

Go to youtube page, play video, click extention once to hide belt, click it once again to show it again.
